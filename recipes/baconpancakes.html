    <p class="paragraph">
      In season 4, episode 16 entitled "Burning Low", we see Jake the Dog
      cooking our dish of choice. He also sings about the dish with a catchy
      tune you can see in the video above.
    </p>
    <h2 class="ingredientshead">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>Quarter teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted and cooled butter</li>
      <li>2 thick cut slices of bacon, pre-cooked</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="instructionshead">Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
        Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl, mix
        together dry ingredients. Beat eggs into 1 1/2 cups milk, then stir in 2
        tablespoons melted cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture
        into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten flour; don't worry
        about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
        Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When
        butter foam subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or
        skillet, adding about half the batter you'd want for the full pancake.
        After about 30 seconds, lay your bacon strip on top of the batter in the
        pan, that has just started to form on the pan. Then add the second half
        of the batter to form a nice even pancake with bacon in the middle.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
        Adjust heat as necessary; usually, first batch will require higher heat
        than subsequent batches. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and
        bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes. Cook until second side is lightly
        browned. Serve, or hold on an ovenproof plate in a 200-degree oven for
        up to 15 minutes.
      </li>
