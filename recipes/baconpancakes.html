    <p class="paragraph">

      cooking our dish of choice. He also sings about the dish with a catchy
      tune you can see in the video above.

    <h2 class="ingredientshead">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>Quarter teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted and cooled butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="instructionshead">Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
      <li>
        Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl, mix
        together dry ingredients. Beat eggs into 1 1/2 cups milk, then stir in 2
        tablespoons melted cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture
        into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten flour; don't worry
        about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When
        butter foam subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or
        skillet, making pancakes of any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary;
        usually, first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches.
        Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, after 2
        to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on an
        ovenproof plate in a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.
      </li>
