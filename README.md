# RecipeWebsite
A recipe website using HTML and CSS.

This project was made with inspiration from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to further enhance my HTML and CSS skills.

## Here are a few of the skills I really worked to improve upon: ##
* More advanced keyframe animations, with multi-animations and delays in place to really bring the landing page to life.
* CSS rule sharing for a cleaner, more intuitive stylesheet. All three recipe webpages share classes to make for faster page building.
* Cleaner HTML, using sub-sections to keep things neat and organized
